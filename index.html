            <h3>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h3>
            <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
                companies has allowed me to develope a skillset that helps me in not just
                development, but in every aspect of any business.<br>
            
                <br>
                I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the 
                world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to 
                sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new 
                world of opportunities.
            </p>

        <div class="midbox2text">
            <p>
                As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's 
                holding you back is yourself. <br>
                <br>
                A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
                <br><br>
                "How big would you dream, if you <span>knew</span> you wouldn't fail?"
                You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to 
                elevate your skills and become a leader in something you are passionate about.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
